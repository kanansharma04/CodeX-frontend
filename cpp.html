    <h4>1. What is virtual inheritance?</h4>
    <p>Virtual inheritance is a technique that ensures only one copy of a base class’s member variables is inherited by
      grandchild-derived classes. Or in simple terms, virtual inheritance is used when we are dealing with a situation
      of multiple inheritances but want to prevent multiple instances of the same class from appearing in the
      inheritance hierarchy.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container my-4">
    <h4>2. What is polymorphism in C++?</h4>
    <p>TPolymorphism is known as many forms of the same thing. In simple terms, we can say that Polymorphism is the
      ability to display a member function in multiple forms depending on the type of object that calls them.

      In other words, we can also say that a man can be an employee to someone, a son of someone, a father of someone,
      and a husband of someone; this is how polymorphism can be projected in real life.

      There is 2 type of polymorphism:<br>

      <strong>Compile Time Polymorphism</strong><br>
      Function Overloading<br>
      Operator Overloading<br>
      <strong>Run Time Polymorphism</strong>
      Function Overriding<br>
      Virtual Function<br>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container my-4">
    <h4>3. What does the Scope Resolution operator do?</h4>
    <p>A scope resolution operator is denoted by a ‘::‘ symbol. Just like its name this operator resolves the barrier of
      scope in a program. A scope resolution operator is used to reference a member function or a global variable out of
      their scope furthermore to which it can also access the concealed variable or function in a program.<br>

      Scope Resolution is used for numerous amounts of tasks:<br>

      1. To access a global variable when there is a local variable with the same name<br>
      2. To define the function outside the class<br>
      3. In case of multiple inheritances<br>
      4. For namespace<br>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container my-4">
    <h4>4. What are the C++ access modifiers?</h4>
    <p>The access restriction specified to the class members( whether it is member function or data member) is known as
      access modifiers/specifiers. <br>

      Access Modifiers are of 3 <br>

      1.Private – It can neither be accessed nor be viewed from outside the class <br>
      2.Protected – It can be accessed if and only if the accessor is the derived class <br>
      3.Public – It can be accessed or be viewed from outside the class <br>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container my-4">
    <h4>5.Can you compile a program without the main function?
    </h4>
    <p>Yes, it is absolutely possible to compile a program without a main(). For example Use Macros that defines the main.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container my-4">
    <h4>6. What is STL?    </h4>
    <p>STL is known as Standard Template Library, it is a library that provides 4 components like container, algorithms, and iterators.

    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container my-4">
    <h4>7. What is the main use of the keyword “Volatile”?</h4>
    <p>Just like its name, things can change suddenly and unexpectantly; So it is used to inform the compiler that the value may change anytime. Also, the volatile keyword prevents the compiler from performing optimization on the code. It was intended to be used when interfacing with memory-mapped hardware, signal handlers, and machine code instruction.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container my-4">
    <h4>8. What is a mutable storage class specifier? How can they be used?</h4>
    <p>Just like its name, the mutable storage class specifier is used only on a class data member to make it modifiable even though the member is part of an object declared as const. Static or const, or reference members cannot use the mutable specifier. When we declare a function as const, this pointer passed to the function becomes const.
    </p>

    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="container my-4">
    <h4>9. What is the function of the keyword “Auto”?</h4>
    <p>The auto keyword may be used to declare a variable with a complex type in a straightforward fashion. You can use auto to declare a variable if the initialization phrase contains templates, pointers to functions, references to members, etc. With type inference capabilities, we can spend less time having to write out things the compiler already knows. As all the types are deduced in the compiler phase only, the time for compilation increases slightly but it does not affect the runtime of the program. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="container my-4">
    <h4>10. When is void() return type used?</h4>
    <p>The void keyword, when used as a function return type, indicates that the function does not return a value. When used as a parameter list for a function, void indicates that the function takes no parameters. Non-Value Returning functions are also known as void functions. They’re called “void” since they’re not designed to return anything. True, but only partially. We can’t return values from void functions, but we can certainly return something. Although void functions have no return type, they can return values.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="container my-4">
    <h4>11. What are void pointers?</h4>
    <p>Just like its name a void pointer is a pointer that is not associated with anything or with any data type. Nevertheless, a void pointer can hold the address value of any type and can be converted from one data type to another.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="container my-4">
    <h4>12. What is ‘this‘ pointer in C++?</h4>
    <p>this pointer enables every object to have access to its own address through an essential pointer. All member functions take this pointer as an implicit argument. this pointer may be used to refer to the calling object within a member function. <br>

     1. this pointer is used to pass an object as a parameter to another <br>
     2. Each object gets its own copy of the data member.<br>
     3. this pointer is used to declare indexers.<br>
    </p>
